3. Enter the text you want to translate.
4. Click **Translate Text**.
5. Copy the translation or click **Speak Translation** to hear it.

## Translation Services

The application uses external translation endpoints. Translation availability and accuracy depend on those services and the selected language pair.

The Speak Translation feature uses the browser's built-in speech synthesis functionality. Available voices depend on the browser, operating system, and installed language voices.

## Future Improvements

- Improve translation reliability.
- Add translation history.
- Support additional language pairs.
